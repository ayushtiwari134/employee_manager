About the project:

This is a basic fully responsive web-application, which has been created using ReactJS. This app categorizes various dummy team members into separate teams. I created this to understand the concepts of the {UseState} and {UseEffect} hooks in ReactJS. I further plan on routing the pages using the 'react-router-dom' package.
